# Decred SM metrics 2021-02

Welcome to the first monthly recap of Decred's social media metrics!

For a bit of a background, this report branched off [Decred Journal](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/). Since [December 2020](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/202012.html#people) issue I am posting highlights and irregularities detected while collecting my monthly snapshots. As an experiment, in February I did not filter the findings for being "big enough" and wrote down anything that felt interesting. The list ended up too big for DJ but I didn't want to throw away half of the findings, and so here we are in a yet another place for number geeks. I will keep posting the biggest highlights in DJ, while these reports will have more details.

So let's begin and see what unusual changes have happened in Feb across ~90 tracked accounts. The changes are between Feb-1 and Mar-1 snapshots.

General:

- main accounts all got a higher than usual increase in following and views
- main [Twitter](https://twitter.com/decredproject) got a massive +1,121 followers (to 42,922). We did not see such an increase since Nov 2018 when it got +1,818.
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/) got +358 subscribers (to 10,559). This is the largest absolute growth since I started monitoring it on May 2018.
- main [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/decredchannel) got +100 subscribers (to 4,420) and +6K views (to 175K) - again a record since my first snapshots in Aug 2018.
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/GJ2GXfz) had pruned 473 inactive users, 1,444 remain
- [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decred/) page got another +3K watchers (to 29K)
- [decredproject](https://www.facebook.com/decredproject/) FB got +44 followers (to 3,755) - not much but it stands out after many months of almost no growth
- [decredproject](https://www.instagram.com/decredproject/) IG got +30 followers (to 635) without any new posts

Personal and topic-focused:

- [\_Checkmatey\_](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_) TW got +30% followers (to 5K) and posted 1.2K tweets at a crazy rate of ~41/day
- [decredDCR](https://twitter.com/decredDCR) TW got +13% followers (to 511) and made 216 tweets (\* between Feb-1 and Mar-7)

- [jz_bz](https://twitter.com/jz_bz) didn't lose any TW followers in Feb. Did the content get less offensive? :D

- [Decred Arabia](https://www.facebook.com/Decred-Arabia-1836611206375151/) FB got +16% followers (to 231)
- [Decred Arabia](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCtB2BfsA2VdT0FJXpsYICA) YT got +239 views (to 1,318), with only 9 videos it is ~150 per video - good for a small non-English channel
