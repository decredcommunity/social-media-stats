# Decred SM metrics 2021-04

Welcome to the 3rd monthly recap of Decred's social media metrics! Here I go through ~90 accounts and report activity that stands out. The changes are between Apr-2 and May-1 snapshots.

Main:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/decredproject) got another solid +763 followers (to 44,391). I discovered a service called Social Blade that has more detailed analytics for [@decredproject](https://socialblade.com/twitter/user/decredproject), although only 1 month of historical data is available and it is not downloadable - unlike [this](https://github.com/decredcommunity/social-media-stats) repo :)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/) got +190 subscribers (to 10,987)
- [Telegram](https://t.me/Decred) got +51 users (to 2,645)
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/GJ2GXfz) has recovered from 2 months of purges and got +157 users (+11%, to 1,566)
- [Matrix](https://chat.decred.org) got +27 users (to 1,566)
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/decredchannel) got +40 subscribers (to 4,500) and +3K views (to 182). Social Blade has more detailed [analytics](https://socialblade.com/youtube/channel/UCJ2bYDaPYHpSmJPh_M5dNSg) for decredchannel.

General:

- [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/decred) got +8% likes (to 10,273)
- [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decred/) page got another +3K watchers (+10%, to 34K)
- [decredproject](https://www.facebook.com/decredproject/) FB got +28 followers (to 3,816) and +45 likes (to 3,457) - not much but it stands out after many snapshots with no growth
- [decredproject](https://www.instagram.com/decredproject/) IG gained +16 followers (to 682), again without posting anything
- the shady [Decredcash](https://www.facebook.com/Decredcash/) FB fluctuates around 2,500 followers. I expected a slow downtrend but I guess it gets a few random users here and there thanks to the general uptick in Decred hype in 2021.

Personal and topic-focused:

- [\_Checkmatey\_](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_) TW got +2,468 followers (+35%, to 9,510), posting "only" 437 tweets this time. Social Blade analytics [projects](https://socialblade.com/twitter/user/_checkmatey_/futureprojections) that at this rate @\_Checkmatey\_ will surpass [@decredproject](https://socialblade.com/twitter/user/decredproject/futureprojections) by 2023.
- an odd event was detected with \_Checkmatey\_'s "Likes" counter: it _reduced_ by ~430 between Apr-14 and Apr-22. iirc "Likes" is how many tweets a user has liked and usually it always goes up. I think it may go down if you unlike a few tweets, but going down by ~430 is odd. I wonder if it is Twitter playing games or some normal activity.
- [PermabullNino](https://twitter.com/PermabullNino) TW got +579 followers (+17%, to 3,970)
- [ConsensusRough](https://twitter.com/ConsensusRough) TW got +75 followers (+13%, to 655)

Non-English and regional:

- [Decred International](https://www.facebook.com/groups/decredinternational/) FB got -27 members (to 874) - first loss since I started tracking it in Sep 2020. Might be due to a drop in Spanish activity.

That's all for now. Shall we try a table format or will it be too unhuman? Let me know in #media.
