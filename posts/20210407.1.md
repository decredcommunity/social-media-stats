# Decred SM metrics 2021-03

Welcome to the second monthly recap of Decred's social media metrics! Here I go through ~90 accounts and report activity that stands out. The changes are between Mar-1 and Apr-2 snapshots.

General:

- main [Twitter](https://twitter.com/decredproject) got a solid +706 followers (to 43,628)
- main [Telegram](https://t.me/Decred) got +76 users (+3%, to 2,594) - third month of growth after a 2+ year decline since I started taking these snapshots (my oldest data point is 4.6K users on Dec 2018)
- project's new [DCRann](https://t.me/s/DCRann) TG channel for announcements gained 86 followers and made 4 posts since it was created on Mar-10
- Discord got -33 users (to 1,409). Our mods did not purge any inactive users, so it may have been Discord's own purge.
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/) had another good month with +238 subscribers (to 10,797)
- [decredproject](https://www.instagram.com/decredproject/) IG gained +23 followers (to 666), again while not posting anything (is it a signal of an opportunity?)
- [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/decred) got +409 likes (to 9,516) since Mar-14 when I started tracking it
- [Gab](https://gab.com/decredproject) account is 11 months old but is still at 7 followers. Without extra outreach and engagement it may not grow by itself.
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/decredproject) is not getting much interaction or "job" requests recently, but the follower count is steadily growing with +20 in March (to 998). LI page was mentioned in a random 2-minute YT explainer [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shGWjzCuFIU) about Decred, showing that some people do look at it when evaluating the project. [Politeia](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/decred-politeia) and [DCRDEX](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/dcrdex) "showcase" pages have 63 and 25 followers, respectively.

Personal and topic-focused:

- "The Machine" aka [\_Checkmatey\_](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_) TW got +1,816 followers (+35%, to 7,042), posting _another_ 1K tweets at ~34 tweets per day
- [PermabullNino](https://twitter.com/PermabullNino) TW gained 398 followers (+13%, to 3,391)
- some other top tweeters of March are [michae2xl](https://twitter.com/michae2xl) (216), [DecredAustralia](https://twitter.com/DecredAustralia) (159), [PermabullNino](https://twitter.com/PermabullNino) (150)
- @Checkmate's [Medium](https://medium.com/@_Checkmatey_) got +5% followers (to 210) - not bad for Medium that ususally grows slowly
- [jz_bz](https://twitter.com/jz_bz) lost 33 followers (to 7,151) _(you hold on there, it's not too bad!)_
- [ConsensusRough](https://twitter.com/ConsensusRough) TW gained a surprising +34% followers (to 580)

Non-English and regional:

- [decredbr](https://t.me/decredbr) TG got +6% users (to 384)
- [Decred_ES](https://twitter.com/Decred_ES) TW got +5% followers (to 1,365)
- [DecredESP](https://www.facebook.com/DecredESP/) FB is labeled as "Internet Company" with a 5-star rating, although the [reviews](https://www.facebook.com/DecredESP/reviews/) are mostly spam
- [DECRED BRasil](https://www.facebook.com/groups/decredbrasil/) FB had a noticeable drop in "posts in the last 30 days" from ~50 to 19. For context, this group has 5,650 members.
