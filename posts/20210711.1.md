## Notes

- I can no longer easily get Facebook metrics because it redirects to login page.
- Even though BR and ES accounts don't show notable dynamics, I added them to watch how they behave after a sharp drop of activity around Jan 2021.
- Twitter Likes is normally a non-decreasing value but sometimes it goes backwards. This happened for multiple accounts in June. I can imagine it dropping by a small value if you manually unlike a few tweets, but dropping by 20+ is odd. One guess is likes go down when liked tweets are deleted. Any insight on this is appreciated.

That's all for now. Still evaluating if these reports worth the effort to produce (although it is hard to resist), so any feedback is welcome on [#research:decred.org](https://chat.decred.org/#/room/#research:decred.org) (guide how to join our chats is [here](https://docs.decred.org/getting-started/joining-matrix-channels/)).
